Objective of the game:
To take more boxes than your opponent.


Basics of the game:
It is a 2-player game
•	Player 1 will be the user.
•	Player 2 will be the computer.
The players will be provided with a 6 by 6 grid, which will look something like this:
    A   B   C   D   E   F
1   +   +   +   +   +   +
    
2   +   +   +   +   +   +

3   +   +   +   +   +   +

4   +   +   +   +   +   +

5   +   +   +   +   +   +

6   +   +   +   +   +   +


How to play:
Two players (user and computer) take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two un-joined adjacent dots. 
•	The user can do this by selecting 2 points, for example, B2 C2.
•	The computer will randomly generate its moves.
A player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point.
The players move in turn, but whenever a player takes a box they must move again.
The game is over when all the boxes (in this case 36) are taken.
The player with the most point wins the game.
